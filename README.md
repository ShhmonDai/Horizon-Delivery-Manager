<h1 align='center'>Welcome to Horizon Delivery Manager</h1>
<h2 align='center'>Custom package management web app for a high-traffic, 430-unit residential building, replacing an inefficient legacy system that users found unusable.</h2>

&nbsp;

<p>Horizon Delivery Manager was created by me when I noticed my work did not have a way to track the shelf locations of incoming deliveries and packages. The BuildingLink that the company used was clunky to use and could only show which room the specific package was located in but not its exact location. 
           
This resulted in the workers avoiding using BuildingLink to look up any of the delivery details. Instead, they would call the front desk on the radio. The front desk would then check and tell them how many packages a person should have. That is, if the front desk wasn't busy with their own problems. As you can imagine, it was tedious and time consuming. 

The workers would also spend up to several minutes trying to find the specific delivery among hundreds of other packages. Keep in mind the building has 430 apartments so there would be a constant stream of deliveries and constant stream of people coming to pick up their stuff. It was a great inconvienience for everyone when the workers spent minutes searching for a single item.</p>

## 📚 Issues for Delivery Manager to solve
- Elderly Hallman Workers refused to use BuildingLink app to check package details (Type and Number of packages) due to complex, hard to see and use UI/UX
- Inefficient login system during busy and fast paced work where several workers shared access to devices
