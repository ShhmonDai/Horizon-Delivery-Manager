<h1 align='center'>Welcome to Horizon Delivery Manager</h1>
<h2 align='center'>A Package manager to simplify organization and package lookup for a busy 400 apartment building.</h2>

&nbsp;

<p>Horizon Delivery Manager was created by me when I noticed my work did not have a way to track the location of incoming deliveries and packages. The BuildingLink that the company used was clunky to use and could only show which room the specific package was located in. This resulted in the workers avoiding using the app to look up any of the delivery details. 
The workers would also spend up to several minutes trying to find the specific delivery among hundreds of other packages. Keep in mind the building has over 400 apartments so there would be a constant stream of deliveries and constant stream of people coming to pick up their stuff. It was a great inconvienience for everyone when the workers spent minutes searching for a single item.</p>

## 📚 Issues for Delivery Manager to solve
- Elderly Hallman Workers refused to use BuildingLink app to check package details (Type and Number of packages) due to complex, hard to see and use UI/UX
- Inefficient login system during busy and fast paced work where several workers shared access to devices
- No abiltiy to track package location within package room. Workers sometimes spent minutes looking through the whole room for an item.

- Improved package lookup times from O(N) to O(1), saving up to several minutes of time per package look up by introducing ability to organize packages by shelf number.
- Encouraged the mostly elderly coworkers to use the web app to look up the packages by simplyfing UI/UX to be easy to use on the go
- Encouraged use by providing easy shared account login through a pin number in addition to standard individual account login
